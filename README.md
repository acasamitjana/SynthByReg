# Synth-by-Reg (SbR): Contrastive learning for synthesis-based registration of paired images

This repository contains code for intermodality registration of paired images (e.g., from the same subject). The method is synthesis based using two different 
losses: _(i)_ a registration loss for image translation at the image level that capitalises on a pre-trained intramodality registration network and _(ii)_ a structure preserving
constraint  based  on  contrastive  learning. We apply this method to the registration of histological sections to MRI slices, a key step in 3D histology reconstruction.
